Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"trailing_whitespace\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
