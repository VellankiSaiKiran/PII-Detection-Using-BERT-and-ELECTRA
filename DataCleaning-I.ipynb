I'm reaching out to share an example of a job-related project I worked on in the past. During my tenure at XYZ Company, I was tasked with developing a user interface for a new software application. The goal of this project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that would make it easy for users to navigate the application and access its features. I began by conducting extensive user research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. This research helped me identify key design elements and features that would enhance the user experience. I then proceeded to create wireframes and prototypes of the interface, ensuring that it was visually appealing and consistent with the company's branding guidelines. I paid close attention to details such as button placement, font selection, and color schemes to create an interface that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Throughout the development process, I worked closely with a team of designers and developers to ensure that the interface met all technical requirements and was compatible with various devices and operating systems. I also conducted rigorous testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues that arose during the development phase. The successful completion of this project resulted in a user interface that was highly praised by both users and stakeholders. The application received positive feedback for its ease of use, intuitive design, and seamless navigation. If you're interested in discussing this project further, feel free to contact me via email at barbara.lee@yahoo.com or by phone at 032-5567-4656. You can also find me at 128 East Oak Street. In my free time, I enjoy playing handball, which helps me stay active and focused. I'm passionate about creating user-centric designs that enhance the overall user experience. I'm confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for your consideration.

Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n

Also, it is important to say that this tool is developed throughout\\n\\nthe project, in the beginning, in the development and when we had everything clearer and\\n\\nat the end to know the organization that should be carried out and the order.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, I applied this tool in my project due to the order that it takes, at the\\n\\ntime of making the prototype of the project, a mindmap was made about what materials\\n\\nwas going to be used, how it was going to work, all that brainstorming was useful organize\\n\\nit in a mindmap to carry out the project. Also at the time of developing the poster, a\\n\\nmindmap was made of how each section should be organized and what information each\\n\\none should carry, in this way the mindmap tool was applied and it was possible to have a\\n\\nvery striking poster.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe insight that I gained was very great, since in my other projects I had not used the\\n\\nmindmapping tool because I did not consider it useful, but at the time of applying the design\\n\\nthinking with the mindmapping tool and the knowledge acquired it was possible to carry\\n\\nout the project and obtain a perfect grade, appropriate to what the problem presented\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nNow that I have discovered the benefit of using the mindmapping tool, I think that what I\\n\\nwould do differently would be to make the most striking mindmaps because some\\n\\ncontained too much information that it was difficult to synthesize what the problem of the\\n\\nproject asked me to do.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Learning Launch\\n\\nPaola Garcia\\n\\nChallenge\\n\\nIn the financial services industry, the strategies developed to manage lending portfolios are developed  through data analysis of past performance.  In the collections environment, analytics and traditional  methods to contact customers (phone, letters and email) are the norm.  As the number of missed  payments on an account increases, the ability to reach customers decreases.   The result is higher  delinquency rates, increase expense and customer complaints.\\n\\nA project was launched to determine how these measures could be improved.  A small team was formed  which included people from various departments including Analytics, Operations, Finance, Marketing to  name a few.   A recommendation was made to utilize design thinking.  Working with our Marketing  Research team several tools were utilized to understand our customer needs and develop some ideas to  test.  To address the needs of a specific persona, Customers who felt uncomfortable discussing their  situation and felt the people they spoke to on the phone lacked empathy, the idea of a collections  website was developed.\\n\\nSelection\\n\\nThe team chose the learning launch to test a collections website.   The learning launch allows for a fast  and inexpensive way to run an experiment to learn.   This was facilitated by the ability to utilize an  outsourced model.  The website functionality was already developed by a vendor and provided the  minimum viable product which met the design criteria.     The learning launch provided the data needed  to determine whether the idea was good or bad.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nThe team developed a detailed plan to launch the experiment including customer segments,  communication methods, measurements, and customer feedback surveys.  The website launched on  time and tested for 90 days.   The results provided significant data that the idea worked as well as new  insights to improve the website and other internal processes.\\n\\nInsight\\n\\nThe learning launch enabled the team to develop and test quickly where there was not past data and  could potentially be a better approach that the traditional methods used.  In addition, it provided a lot  of customer feedback that changed the existing strategies (phone, letters, email) and enhancements to  the company website.  Ongoing use of the website has Increased  collection rates and decreased   expenses and complaints.\\n\\nApproach\\n\\nThe learning launch was the best approach since we had the ability to launch quickly.  Had there not  been an existing vendor with the necessary tool, another approach would have been necessary as  prioritization of technology builds can often take significant time.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Visualisation\\n\\nChallenge & Selection\\n\\nThe challenge I've chosen to work on is women's safety. I'd be doing a design intervention to design a  product/ system that makes women feel and be safe, especially at dark, isolated places.\\n\\nI chose the Visualisation tool to help me go through the steps of user research, empathy mapping,  ideation, and prototyping because it helps me to convey my vision as well as decipher more accurately  what the other person(user) is actually conveying- their pain points, fears, needs, desires, etc.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nI made a compilation of several images, some from the internet, some from horror or crime movie  scenes, and tried to pinpoint the exact type and level of fear women face while roaming isolated places  alone. I prepared a questionnaire in which I included these photos.\\n\\nLater I did Ideation Sketches, made some rendered concepts, and at a later stage even 3D prototype and  did a survey where these sketches and images were shared. It helped me gain a proper understanding  whether the users thought it'd be helpful or not.\\n\\nFinally, my product poster was designed more visually with more pictures than text, to illicit the emotion  of safety against usual uncertainty and fear, when one uses the service I designed.\\n\\nInsight and Approach\\n\\nWhile I used the Visualisation tool earlier, I used to restrict it to convey my ideas only in the Concept and  Prototyping phases. But this time, I used it even in my initial User Research and Poster Design of the  Final concept. I gained some very precise understanding of what emotions would the users feel in a real  situation and of what types and also to what levels. All this was possible due to the accuracy of the  visual element.\\n\\nMore importantly, I noticed that after the Final Design was made and piloted, it was much more  convenient and efficient conveying it's usage and purpose to the users when I used visuals like  photographs, sketches along with storyboards as to how to use the service.\\n\\nI'd definitely use this Visualisation tool more extensively and creatively in my future projects as its very  efficient and effective. It removes the chance of any ambiguity in communication between me and all  stakeholders, namely users, design heads, design team, investors and sales and marketing team.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n

The challenge is to increase awareness of our existence to people who may have never heard of across Saudi Arabia and consequently increase sales . Selection : We picked the Learning Launch tool to gather data and conduct quickly how our growth may be in the future and if or if not currently is the right time to make this new commitment . Application : The application process is in two phases : Phase 1 : This is the phase where we are investing more in out digital marketing and expanding its scope , letting people know where they can find us and what we offer now from their phone / computer to their door step using social media platforms and expanding our key words hits for searches . Here we are trying to expand the awareness of the website . This tests out how many visits we may get in e period of time . Phase 2 : Letting people know now for that for a period of time we offer shipping to all of Saudi Arabia and that our services is available to them and with each order we are giving 3 product samples as well as giving a 10 % discount if the consumer signs up for our email list . This sets out how many purchases we may get within the time frame and the samples will get them the experience something new and exciting . Insight : By using the Learning launch tool we ( 1 ) increased the awareness of the store ( 2 ) we gathered data that will help us decide for a full time commitment to expanding our target . Approach : Learning Launch is an amazing tool , it is a learning experiment that is affordable and helps to collect new data and decide based on the data what are the best choices to make for your company . This tool helps us to fail fast to succeed sooner .\",\n          \"Visualization Tool 1 . Challenge One of the projects we recently had at school was about finding new business opportunities for second life batteries . For this project , a car manufacturer was our main stakeholder , the one looking for repurposing the batteries and generate a new business model . I come from a design background and had little or not knowledge at all in regards of second life batteries , how do they work , how is the batteries business nor the manufacturer business . 2 . Selection The visualization tool helped me to understand better the context . Reunited with two different employees from the car manufacturer , I use the visualization tool to help me see the big picture . In other words , how is the current business , who are their clients , what are their values , among other questions . This process helped me to define the scope and find the relationship between the batteries and the company . In addition , since some of the terms are really engineering ones that I had not knowledge , the visualization tool made the communication easier , so mechanical and electrical matter could be described in visual modes . 3 . Application I start by asking some basic information regarding the company and why they considered this new project . Right after I began with one battery drawing in the middle and start asking questions regarding the topic . I asked the participants to draw their ideas and concepts of the answer . A lot of arrows were used to help to see the relation between all those elements . One of the most feared things about using the visualization tool with the stakeholders is the classic \\u201c I do not know how to draw \\u201d . As soon as I started to explain and take out markers , the face of the stakeholders described everything . One even mentioned , \\u201c Do n\\u2019t judge me for my drawing skills \\u201d . But it was just a matter of time for them to loosen up and stop caring about drawing beautiful or not . Finally , we came out with a great visualization that explains the whole idea of the project . In other words , what we know , what we do not know and what we need to know . The scope was more clearly defined and grounded . 4 . Insight I got a lot of insights from this session . First of all , the whole project was clearer , for both sides , the stakeholders and myself . From both sides the in - depth knowledge obtained was very valuable . Additionally it helped to be all in the same page of what the challenge was . Since , the whole visualization was co - created . This visualization can also be further used to explain the challenge to different people within the company . It turned out that this tool really made us step out of the box and see from the outside . 5 . Approach I believe the use of the visualization tool went the right way . Nevertheless , there is always space for improvement . One of the things I would have done differently is including more people into the tool . Secondly , maybe make a second visualization , something more \\u201c clear and pleasant to see \\u201d right after all the discussion and feedback . Then , the second visualization can be better utilised for other purposes . 1 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why .\",\n          \"Baha Du, a seasoned geologist with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the Earth, embarked on a remarkable project in the rugged terrains of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Armed with his trusty geological hammer and a keen eye for detail, Baha set out to investigate a series of enigmatic rock formations that hinted at a hidden story beneath the surface. With his years of experience in deciphering the language of rocks, Baha meticulously collected samples and meticulously documented his findings. Each rock specimen held a clue, a piece of the puzzle that would eventually reveal the geological history of the region. As Baha delved deeper into his research, he discovered evidence of ancient volcanic activity and tectonic shifts that had shaped the landscape over millions of years. The rock formations he studied bore witness to cataclysmic events, revealing layers of molten rock that had cooled and solidified, forming intricate patterns and textures. Baha's dedication and perseverance paid off when he stumbled upon a rare and remarkable mineral deposit. The discovery held the potential to shed light on the region's geological evolution and could have significant implications for mining and resource exploration. With excitement coursing through his veins, Baha reached out to colleagues and experts in the field to share his findings. He presented his research at conferences, sparking discussions and generating interest among fellow geologists and industry professionals. Baha's project culminated in a comprehensive report that detailed his findings and conclusions. The report was widely circulated among the scientific community and mining companies, earning Baha recognition for his expertise and dedication to unraveling the secrets of the Earth.

The challenge is to increase awareness of our existence to people who may have never heard of across Saudi Arabia and consequently increase sales . Selection : We picked the Learning Launch tool to gather data and conduct quickly how our growth may be in the future and if or if not currently is the right time to make this new commitment . Application : The application process is in two phases : Phase 1 : This is the phase where we are investing more in out digital marketing and expanding its scope , letting people know where they can find us and what we offer now from their phone / computer to their door step using social media platforms and expanding our key words hits for searches . Here we are trying to expand the awareness of the website . This tests out how many visits we may get in e period of time . Phase 2 : Letting people know now for that for a period of time we offer shipping to all of Saudi Arabia and that our services is available to them and with each order we are giving 3 product samples as well as giving a 10 % discount if the consumer signs up for our email list . This sets out how many purchases we may get within the time frame and the samples will get them the experience something new and exciting . Insight : By using the Learning launch tool we ( 1 ) increased the awareness of the store ( 2 ) we gathered data that will help us decide for a full time commitment to expanding our target . Approach : Learning Launch is an amazing tool , it is a learning experiment that is affordable and helps to collect new data and decide based on the data what are the best choices to make for your company . This tool helps us to fail fast to succeed sooner .\",\n          \"Visualization Tool 1 . Challenge One of the projects we recently had at school was about finding new business opportunities for second life batteries . For this project , a car manufacturer was our main stakeholder , the one looking for repurposing the batteries and generate a new business model . I come from a design background and had little or not knowledge at all in regards of second life batteries , how do they work , how is the batteries business nor the manufacturer business . 2 . Selection The visualization tool helped me to understand better the context . Reunited with two different employees from the car manufacturer , I use the visualization tool to help me see the big picture . In other words , how is the current business , who are their clients , what are their values , among other questions . This process helped me to define the scope and find the relationship between the batteries and the company . In addition , since some of the terms are really engineering ones that I had not knowledge , the visualization tool made the communication easier , so mechanical and electrical matter could be described in visual modes . 3 . Application I start by asking some basic information regarding the company and why they considered this new project . Right after I began with one battery drawing in the middle and start asking questions regarding the topic . I asked the participants to draw their ideas and concepts of the answer . A lot of arrows were used to help to see the relation between all those elements . One of the most feared things about using the visualization tool with the stakeholders is the classic \\u201c I do not know how to draw \\u201d . As soon as I started to explain and take out markers , the face of the stakeholders described everything . One even mentioned , \\u201c Do n\\u2019t judge me for my drawing skills \\u201d . But it was just a matter of time for them to loosen up and stop caring about drawing beautiful or not . Finally , we came out with a great visualization that explains the whole idea of the project . In other words , what we know , what we do not know and what we need to know . The scope was more clearly defined and grounded . 4 . Insight I got a lot of insights from this session . First of all , the whole project was clearer , for both sides , the stakeholders and myself . From both sides the in - depth knowledge obtained was very valuable . Additionally it helped to be all in the same page of what the challenge was . Since , the whole visualization was co - created . This visualization can also be further used to explain the challenge to different people within the company . It turned out that this tool really made us step out of the box and see from the outside . 5 . Approach I believe the use of the visualization tool went the right way . Nevertheless , there is always space for improvement . One of the things I would have done differently is including more people into the tool . Secondly , maybe make a second visualization , something more \\u201c clear and pleasant to see \\u201d right after all the discussion and feedback . Then , the second visualization can be better utilised for other purposes . 1 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why .\",\n          \"Baha Du, a seasoned geologist with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the Earth, embarked on a remarkable project in the rugged terrains of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Armed with his trusty geological hammer and a keen eye for detail, Baha set out to investigate a series of enigmatic rock formations that hinted at a hidden story beneath the surface. With his years of experience in deciphering the language of rocks, Baha meticulously collected samples and meticulously documented his findings. Each rock specimen held a clue, a piece of the puzzle that would eventually reveal the geological history of the region. As Baha delved deeper into his research, he discovered evidence of ancient volcanic activity and tectonic shifts that had shaped the landscape over millions of years. The rock formations he studied bore witness to cataclysmic events, revealing layers of molten rock that had cooled and solidified, forming intricate patterns and textures. Baha's dedication and perseverance paid off when he stumbled upon a rare and remarkable mineral deposit. The discovery held the potential to shed light on the region's geological evolution and could have significant implications for mining and resource exploration. With excitement coursing through his veins, Baha reached out to colleagues and experts in the field to share his findings. He presented his research at conferences, sparking discussions and generating interest among fellow geologists and industry professionals. Baha's project culminated in a comprehensive report that detailed his findings and conclusions. The report was widely circulated among the scientific community and mining companies, earning Baha recognition for his expertise and dedication to unraveling the secrets of the Earth. Throughout his project, Baha maintained open communication with stakeholders, including local communities and environmental organizations. He ensured that his work adhered to the highest ethical and environmental standards, minimizing the impact on the fragile ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

The challenge is to increase awareness of our existence to people who may have never heard of across Saudi Arabia and consequently increase sales . Selection : We picked the Learning Launch tool to gather data and conduct quickly how our growth may be in the future and if or if not currently is the right time to make this new commitment . Application : The application process is in two phases : Phase 1 : This is the phase where we are investing more in out digital marketing and expanding its scope , letting people know where they can find us and what we offer now from their phone / computer to their door step using social media platforms and expanding our key words hits for searches . Here we are trying to expand the awareness of the website . This tests out how many visits we may get in e period of time . Phase 2 : Letting people know now for that for a period of time we offer shipping to all of Saudi Arabia and that our services is available to them and with each order we are giving 3 product samples as well as giving a 10 % discount if the consumer signs up for our email list . This sets out how many purchases we may get within the time frame and the samples will get them the experience something new and exciting . Insight : By using the Learning launch tool we ( 1 ) increased the awareness of the store ( 2 ) we gathered data that will help us decide for a full time commitment to expanding our target . Approach : Learning Launch is an amazing tool , it is a learning experiment that is affordable and helps to collect new data and decide based on the data what are the best choices to make for your company . This tool helps us to fail fast to succeed sooner .\",\n          \"Visualization Tool 1 . Challenge One of the projects we recently had at school was about finding new business opportunities for second life batteries . For this project , a car manufacturer was our main stakeholder , the one looking for repurposing the batteries and generate a new business model . I come from a design background and had little or not knowledge at all in regards of second life batteries , how do they work , how is the batteries business nor the manufacturer business . 2 . Selection The visualization tool helped me to understand better the context . Reunited with two different employees from the car manufacturer , I use the visualization tool to help me see the big picture . In other words , how is the current business , who are their clients , what are their values , among other questions . This process helped me to define the scope and find the relationship between the batteries and the company . In addition , since some of the terms are really engineering ones that I had not knowledge , the visualization tool made the communication easier , so mechanical and electrical matter could be described in visual modes . 3 . Application I start by asking some basic information regarding the company and why they considered this new project . Right after I began with one battery drawing in the middle and start asking questions regarding the topic . I asked the participants to draw their ideas and concepts of the answer . A lot of arrows were used to help to see the relation between all those elements . One of the most feared things about using the visualization tool with the stakeholders is the classic \\u201c I do not know how to draw \\u201d . As soon as I started to explain and take out markers , the face of the stakeholders described everything . One even mentioned , \\u201c Do n\\u2019t judge me for my drawing skills \\u201d . But it was just a matter of time for them to loosen up and stop caring about drawing beautiful or not . Finally , we came out with a great visualization that explains the whole idea of the project . In other words , what we know , what we do not know and what we need to know . The scope was more clearly defined and grounded . 4 . Insight I got a lot of insights from this session . First of all , the whole project was clearer , for both sides , the stakeholders and myself . From both sides the in - depth knowledge obtained was very valuable . Additionally it helped to be all in the same page of what the challenge was . Since , the whole visualization was co - created . This visualization can also be further used to explain the challenge to different people within the company . It turned out that this tool really made us step out of the box and see from the outside . 5 . Approach I believe the use of the visualization tool went the right way . Nevertheless , there is always space for improvement . One of the things I would have done differently is including more people into the tool . Secondly , maybe make a second visualization , something more \\u201c clear and pleasant to see \\u201d right after all the discussion and feedback . Then , the second visualization can be better utilised for other purposes . 1 . Approach : Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you selected or a different one -- and the reason(s ) why .\",\n          \"Baha Du, a seasoned geologist with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the Earth, embarked on a remarkable project in the rugged terrains of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Armed with his trusty geological hammer and a keen eye for detail, Baha set out to investigate a series of enigmatic rock formations that hinted at a hidden story beneath the surface. With his years of experience in deciphering the language of rocks, Baha meticulously collected samples and meticulously documented his findings. Each rock specimen held a clue, a piece of the puzzle that would eventually reveal the geological history of the region. As Baha delved deeper into his research, he discovered evidence of ancient volcanic activity and tectonic shifts that had shaped the landscape over millions of years. The rock formations he studied bore witness to cataclysmic events, revealing layers of molten rock that had cooled and solidified, forming intricate patterns and textures. Baha's dedication and perseverance paid off when he stumbled upon a rare and remarkable mineral deposit. The discovery held the potential to shed light on the region's geological evolution and could have significant implications for mining and resource exploration. With excitement coursing through his veins, Baha reached out to colleagues and experts in the field to share his findings. He presented his research at conferences, sparking discussions and generating interest among fellow geologists and industry professionals. Baha's project culminated in a comprehensive report that detailed his findings and conclusions. The report was widely circulated among the scientific community and mining companies, earning Baha recognition for his expertise and dedication to unraveling the secrets of the Earth.

My journey into the world of astronomy began in my childhood when I was fascinated by the night sky and its countless wonders. I spent countless hours stargazing and reading books about the cosmos, which eventually led me to pursue a career in astronomy. One of the most memorable moments in my career was when I led a team of astronomers to solve a puzzling phenomenon observed in the constellation Orion. A group of stars in the constellation appeared to be exhibiting erratic behavior, causing their brightness to fluctuate in an unpredictable manner. Our team dedicated months to collecting data and analyzing the stars' behavior using advanced telescopes and software. After meticulously sifting through the data, we discovered that the unusual variations in brightness were caused by a rare type of binary star system known as a cataclysmic variable star. In this system, one of the stars is a white dwarf, and the other is a larger companion star. Material from the companion star is being transferred onto the white dwarf, resulting in sporadic outbursts of energy that cause the system's brightness to change dramatically. Our findings provided valuable insights into the behavior of these fascinating binary star systems and helped us better understand the processes that shape their evolution. The research was published in a leading astronomy journal and was met with great enthusiasm by the scientific community. It was incredibly satisfying to play a role in unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

To do so , we have a huge database of information concerning the targeted Youth . The challenge I face when applying the Mind Mapping tool was the unstructured outdated Data . However , I worked hard to try and identify patterns in the Data to find a group of Youth with a specific set of skills to be part of a voluntary opportunity . Application : I chose the Mind Mapping Tool to address my challenge because it allowed me to brainstorm and find ways to restructure my data . I started by quickly scanning and identifying the exact skills I need my volunteers to have to comply for the volunteering opportunity , and then Mapped out the Database , filtering data accordingly to shrink down the sample of possible Youth to be selected . Once I had a reasonable sample number , I created a simple Map of skills and simple questions to ask to categorize data and reach a final list of candidates . I shared the process with a couple of colleagues to create a small team and work on this task together , we sat down and had a quick brainstorming / Discussion session to make sure the Mapped out criteria were addressing all points and skills needed and then moved into application . Insight and Approach : What I \\u2019ve learned using this tool was that having a clear set map or plan makes analyzing data much easier which in its roles help in achieving my accurate desired results . It also helps working in a team and exchanging thoughts and ideas , it opens up your mind to new ideas and encourages creativity in tools and methods chosen to address certain challenges . We ended up choosing a number of volunteers real quick with the needed skills to be part of this volunteering opportunity in no time , from a database that has old Data and is completely unstructured and also helped in creating a structure for the same Database . I have found this tool very useful , and will definitely be utilizing the other tools for future challenges .\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Visualization Challenge & Selection I am working as a program manager in my organization , responsible for managing data analytics program with multiple sub - projects running under the same . In one of the major programs , there are multiple teams in different time - zones responsible for the delivery outcome as release at definite interval of time . The teams use Scrum framework as execution model and required to integrate after the development activities . While managing the program , I saw one of the challenges to bring the holistic picture of the entire release plan with clear accountabilities . I am always convinced with the power of visualisation in both personal and professional areas . I thought of applying the powerful technique of visualisation to overcome this problem and to help my teams delivering with better efficiencies . The entire information containing the scope , boundaries , relevant timelines , point of integration , key stakeholders is visible and transparent to everyone in the team which brought in absolute clarity to tasks , critical path and accountabilities . This used to captured earlier in old waterfall approach as detailed project plans but missing for detailed set of requirements in sprints , releases etc . Application I started capturing all the relevant information based on the needs and expectations of different teams and stakeholders involved . With the help of directions , efforts and estimates I tried to bring in a clear and concise view with all relevant information , with focus on not having over information . As a inspect and adapt mechanism , I shared a draft view with all stakeholders to gather their inputs and make it valuable with the right information for each set of stakeholders . I prepared a specific questionnaire to gather the right kind of information with custom questions : 1 . What key information(s ) is missing in the plan ? 2 . Is this plan able to meet all the requirements that you are looking for ? 3 . Is this plan providing you a clear and concise view ? Etc .. Once the inputs are gathered , I revised and enhanced it before applying it . During one of the discussion forums , I briefed the stakeholders with the purpose of the plan and how to use it . I later on applied the same technique to approach different problems during the retrospection . A brief summary for a different set of stakeholders was added to make the information more meaningful . I worked through different versions to make it more intuitive to reflect the risks areas , important milestones etc . Insight & Approach Well , I got a very positive feedback on the visualisation of all the different phases and details captured in the plan . The queries on the basic information reduced and most importantly every details is visible and transparent to anyone both internal \\u2013 Development Teams , Product , Sales , Marketing , in the organisation and external - the Customer . The technique has given the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problem \\u2013 not having a consolidated / clear view . This course has been an eyeopener to me to focus on the purpose and how systematically I can proceed with engagement and collaboration to address the concern .\",\n          \"Challenge The challenge being tackled was introducing a new Customer Relationship Management system our company . It had been noted that there were n\\u2019t proper records of clients who had visited any of the company \\u2019s branches looking to be served or to make enquiries . It was thus difficult to assess the nature of clients that were served , whether their issues had been successfully resolved and how long this had taken . It was therefore important for the company to introduce a new system that would tackle these challenges . This system , called CRM , was important since it would enable the recording of all customer interactions by the company \\u2019s staff , including the client \\u2019s personal details , their enquiries and how long it took to resolve each issue that a client raised . In the long run , this would be helpful in determining what the key touch points with clients are , which would in turn help the company in : \\u2022 Staffing - Allocating staff to areas that handled more clients . \\u2022 Improving Turn Around Times - The system would show how long each customer \\u2019s enquiry or instruction took to resolve and what areas would require further training for the staff . \\u2022 Mode of contact \\u2013 How the interaction with the client was made , e.g. through email , walk in , an intermediary or by phone . Selection Leaning Launch tool was the tool of choice for this challenge . A learning launch ideally means conducting a small experiment to test a developed idea in the real world . It is an experiment that involves introducing a product or service into the real world to gauge how it integrates into it and performs . The learning launch tool was selected as it helps in gathering insights on how to improve on the product . Application Since the system had already been created , the learning launch would involve introducing the system in two of the company \\u2019s branches . The period for the learning launch was set to one week , as this was deemed ample time for the staff to get used to the system and be in a position to offer meaningful feedback . Staff from the two branches were taken for an intense training on how to use this system to open , record , assign and close customer interactions . A representative from the team involved in developing the system was sent to each of these branches to assist during the week , in case of any issues arising . Staff in these two central branches were then given access rights to this system . The staff were also asked to take note of all major highlights of the system as well as areas that needed to be totally overhauled , those that needed to be improved on and those that just needed a little tweaking . Focus was given on ensuring that every customer interaction was input to the system , as it is only this way that the system , and any data derived from it , would be useful . Emphasis was also given on ensuring that the records input to the system were correct and timely . Insight Almost immediately , there were positive results from use of the system . Due to the system escalating issues that were not handled on time , we learnt that customer instructions were handled promptly and marked as closed in the system . Turnaround time for cases was therefore drastically shortened . Another major improvement was on the following up on cases that had been handled elsewhere or by a different member of staff . This became easier , since , instead of having to call the staff member initially involved , it was now possible to determine what the client \\u2019s query was and how far the case was from completion , just at the click of a few buttons . The learning launch also made it easier to verify which lines of business had the highest number of interactions and which ones require the most time to resolve . All this information was important as it would help in determining what areas needed more focus on in terms of staffing and training . Feedback from the launch also indicated that a few system changes had to be made . These mainly involved user preferences on the system \\u2019s interface and not how the system functioned . There was also an issue on how to group the different types of customer enquiries so as to ensure that they were all encompassed in the groups created in the system . Approach To improve on the effectiveness of the learning launch as used , it would be important to involve more customer - facing staff members in the development of the system . This is because they would give the system developers more insight on the day to day interactions with clients and improve on the way these are implemented in the system It is also important to conduct intensive training on the system before the learning launch to ensure that the users are well conversant with it . This would ensure that a successful learning launch is not hindered by having to retrain staff while the testing is in progress .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label_seq\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ixfbw0LXsbr3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713386227739,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Kiran Reddy Vellanki","userId":"14861279026824216393"}},"outputId":"a2c6bdc8-a7ec-40a3-9829-6d49b5ca1f11"},"id":"Ixfbw0LXsbr3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 11215 entries, 0 to 11214\n","Data columns (total 2 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------     --------------  ----- \n"," 0   sentence   11215 non-null  object\n"," 1   label_seq  11215 non-null  object\n","dtypes: object(2)\n","memory usage: 175.4+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"n4NWcK58uzb8"},"id":"n4NWcK58uzb8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["new_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['document', 'token', 'label'])\n","\n","# Use pandas.concat for more efficiency\n","data_frames = []  # To collect all the small dataframes\n","\n","# Process each row in the DataFrame\n","for index, row in final.iterrows():\n","    # Tokenize the sentence\n","    tokens = row['sentence'].split()\n","    # Get the label sequence\n","    labels = row['label_seq']\n","\n","    # Make sure the length of tokens and labels are the same\n","    min_length = min(len(tokens), len(labels))\n","    tokens = tokens[:min_length]\n","    labels = labels[:min_length]\n","\n","    # Create a small dataframe for the current row and add it to the list\n","    temp_df = pd.DataFrame({\n","        'document': [index] * min_length,\n","        'token': tokens,\n","        'label': labels\n","    })\n","    data_frames.append(temp_df)\n","\n","# Concatenate all small dataframes into one\n","new_df = pd.concat(data_frames, ignore_index=True)\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fFqm0PDFsblr"},"id":"fFqm0PDFsblr","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["new_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"-KxvrEKnuGgJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713386236656,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Kiran Reddy Vellanki","userId":"14861279026824216393"}},"outputId":"a4d72144-1818-4842-b7e6-7db68716c25b"},"id":"-KxvrEKnuGgJ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         document       token label\n","0               0      Design     O\n","1               0    Thinking     O\n","2               0         for     O\n","3               0  innovation     O\n","4               0   reflexion     O\n","...           ...         ...   ...\n","5972025     11214     overall     O\n","5972026     11214     success     O\n","5972027     11214          of     O\n","5972028     11214         the     O\n","5972029     11214    project.
