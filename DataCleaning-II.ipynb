To do so , we have a huge database of information concerning the targeted Youth . The challenge I face when applying the Mind Mapping tool was the unstructured outdated Data . However , I worked hard to try and identify patterns in the Data to find a group of Youth with a specific set of skills to be part of a voluntary opportunity . Application : I chose the Mind Mapping Tool to address my challenge because it allowed me to brainstorm and find ways to restructure my data . I started by quickly scanning and identifying the exact skills I need my volunteers to have to comply for the volunteering opportunity , and then Mapped out the Database , filtering data accordingly to shrink down the sample of possible Youth to be selected . Once I had a reasonable sample number , I created a simple Map of skills and simple questions to ask to categorize data and reach a final list of candidates . I shared the process with a couple of colleagues to create a small team and work on this task together , we sat down and had a quick brainstorming / Discussion session to make sure the Mapped out criteria were addressing all points and skills needed and then moved into application . Insight and Approach : What I \\u2019ve learned using this tool was that having a clear set map or plan makes analyzing data much easier which in its roles help in achieving my accurate desired results . It also helps working in a team and exchanging thoughts and ideas , it opens up your mind to new ideas and encourages creativity in tools and methods chosen to address certain challenges . We ended up choosing a number of volunteers real quick with the needed skills to be part of this volunteering opportunity in no time , from a database that has old Data and is completely unstructured and also helped in creating a structure for the same Database . I have found this tool very useful , and will definitely be utilizing the other tools for future challenges .\",\n          \"Reflection \\u2013 Visualization Challenge & Selection I am working as a program manager in my organization , responsible for managing data analytics program with multiple sub - projects running under the same . In one of the major programs , there are multiple teams in different time - zones responsible for the delivery outcome as release at definite interval of time . The teams use Scrum framework as execution model and required to integrate after the development activities . While managing the program , I saw one of the challenges to bring the holistic picture of the entire release plan with clear accountabilities . I am always convinced with the power of visualisation in both personal and professional areas . I thought of applying the powerful technique of visualisation to overcome this problem and to help my teams delivering with better efficiencies . The entire information containing the scope , boundaries , relevant timelines , point of integration , key stakeholders is visible and transparent to everyone in the team which brought in absolute clarity to tasks , critical path and accountabilities . This used to captured earlier in old waterfall approach as detailed project plans but missing for detailed set of requirements in sprints , releases etc . Application I started capturing all the relevant information based on the needs and expectations of different teams and stakeholders involved . With the help of directions , efforts and estimates I tried to bring in a clear and concise view with all relevant information , with focus on not having over information . As a inspect and adapt mechanism , I shared a draft view with all stakeholders to gather their inputs and make it valuable with the right information for each set of stakeholders . I prepared a specific questionnaire to gather the right kind of information with custom questions : 1 . What key information(s ) is missing in the plan ? 2 . Is this plan able to meet all the requirements that you are looking for ? 3 . Is this plan providing you a clear and concise view ? Etc .. Once the inputs are gathered , I revised and enhanced it before applying it . During one of the discussion forums , I briefed the stakeholders with the purpose of the plan and how to use it . I later on applied the same technique to approach different problems during the retrospection . A brief summary for a different set of stakeholders was added to make the information more meaningful . I worked through different versions to make it more intuitive to reflect the risks areas , important milestones etc . Insight & Approach Well , I got a very positive feedback on the visualisation of all the different phases and details captured in the plan . The queries on the basic information reduced and most importantly every details is visible and transparent to anyone both internal \\u2013 Development Teams , Product , Sales , Marketing , in the organisation and external - the Customer . The technique has given the diverse group of stakeholders a focal point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problem \\u2013 not having a consolidated / clear view . This course has been an eyeopener to me to focus on the purpose and how systematically I can proceed with engagement and collaboration to address the concern .\",\n          \"Challenge The challenge being tackled was introducing a new Customer Relationship Management system our company . It had been noted that there were n\\u2019t proper records of clients who had visited any of the company \\u2019s branches looking to be served or to make enquiries . It was thus difficult to assess the nature of clients that were served , whether their issues had been successfully resolved and how long this had taken . It was therefore important for the company to introduce a new system that would tackle these challenges . This system , called CRM , was important since it would enable the recording of all customer interactions by the company \\u2019s staff , including the client \\u2019s personal details , their enquiries and how long it took to resolve each issue that a client raised . In the long run , this would be helpful in determining what the key touch points with clients are , which would in turn help the company in : \\u2022 Staffing - Allocating staff to areas that handled more clients . \\u2022 Improving Turn Around Times - The system would show how long each customer \\u2019s enquiry or instruction took to resolve and what areas would require further training for the staff . \\u2022 Mode of contact \\u2013 How the interaction with the client was made , e.g. through email , walk in , an intermediary or by phone . Selection Leaning Launch tool was the tool of choice for this challenge . A learning launch ideally means conducting a small experiment to test a developed idea in the real world . It is an experiment that involves introducing a product or service into the real world to gauge how it integrates into it and performs . The learning launch tool was selected as it helps in gathering insights on how to improve on the product . Application Since the system had already been created , the learning launch would involve introducing the system in two of the company \\u2019s branches . The period for the learning launch was set to one week , as this was deemed ample time for the staff to get used to the system and be in a position to offer meaningful feedback . Staff from the two branches were taken for an intense training on how to use this system to open , record , assign and close customer interactions . A representative from the team involved in developing the system was sent to each of these branches to assist during the week , in case of any issues arising . Staff in these two central branches were then given access rights to this system . The staff were also asked to take note of all major highlights of the system as well as areas that needed to be totally overhauled , those that needed to be improved on and those that just needed a little tweaking . Focus was given on ensuring that every customer interaction was input to the system , as it is only this way that the system , and any data derived from it , would be useful . Emphasis was also given on ensuring that the records input to the system were correct and timely . Insight Almost immediately , there were positive results from use of the system . Due to the system escalating issues that were not handled on time , we learnt that customer instructions were handled promptly and marked as closed in the system . Turnaround time for cases was therefore drastically shortened . Another major improvement was on the following up on cases that had been handled elsewhere or by a different member of staff . This became easier , since , instead of having to call the staff member initially involved , it was now possible to determine what the client \\u2019s query was and how far the case was from completion , just at the click of a few buttons . The learning launch also made it easier to verify which lines of business had the highest number of interactions and which ones require the most time to resolve . All this information was important as it would help in determining what areas needed more focus on in terms of staffing and training . Feedback from the launch also indicated that a few system changes had to be made . These mainly involved user preferences on the system \\u2019s interface and not how the system functioned . There was also an issue on how to group the different types of customer enquiries so as to ensure that they were all encompassed in the groups created in the system . Approach To improve on the effectiveness of the learning launch as used , it would be important to involve more customer - facing staff members in the development of the system . This is because they would give the system developers more insight on the day to day interactions with clients and improve on the way these are implemented in the system It is also important to conduct intensive training on the system before the learning launch to ensure that the users are well conversant with it . This would ensure that a successful learning launch is not hindered by having to retrain staff while the testing is in progress .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","def split_text_preserving_sentences(essay, labels, chunk_size=500):\n","    # This function attempts to split the text into chunks that are close to chunk_size words,\n","    # but without splitting in the middle of a sentence.\n","    words = essay.split()\n","    current_chunk = []\n","    label_chunks = []\n","    word_chunks = []\n","    current_label_chunk = []\n","    word_count = 0\n","\n","    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n","        current_chunk.append(word)\n","        current_label_chunk.append(labels[i])\n","        word_count += 1\n","\n","        # Check if we're at a potential split point\n","        if word_count >= chunk_size and (word.endswith('.') or word.endswith('!') or word.endswith('?')):\n","            word_chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))\n","            label_chunks.append(current_label_chunk)\n","            current_chunk = []\n","            current_label_chunk = []\n","            word_count = 0\n","\n","    # Add the last chunk if there is any residue\n","    if current_chunk:\n","        word_chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))\n","        label_chunks.append(current_label_chunk)\n","\n","    return word_chunks, label_chunks\n","\n","# Assuming `grouped` is your DataFrame and it contains 'essay' and 'labels' columns\n","new_rows = []\n","\n","for _, row in grouped.iterrows():\n","    essay_chunks, label_chunks = split_text_preserving_sentences(row['essay'], row['labels'], chunk_size=500)\n","    for chunk, label_chunk in zip(essay_chunks, label_chunks):\n","        new_rows.append({'essay': chunk, 'labels': label_chunk})\n","\n","new_df = pd.DataFrame(new_rows)\n","\n","# Now new_df contains the essays split close to 500 words, attempting not to split sentences in the middle\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZY1HuFMpzibM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["new_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"a87E4hn_zmS3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713471304376,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":423,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Kiran Reddy Vellanki","userId":"14861279026824216393"}},"outputId":"77da5b12-3d24-4d2a-9d75-61f61a6891e4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                   essay  \\\n","0      Design Thinking for innovation reflexion -

This project involved the complete overhaul of the accounting system for a local non-profit organization, the Willow Creek Community Center. The Willow Creek Community Center had been operating for over two decades, but their accounting practices had become outdated and inefficient. As a result, they were facing challenges in tracking their financial transactions, generating accurate reports, and ensuring compliance with tax regulations. Manchu recognized the need for a comprehensive solution and proposed a plan to modernize the organization's accounting system. After receiving approval from the board of directors, Manchu began the process of implementing new software, establishing standardized procedures, and training the staff on the new system. Throughout the project, Manchu demonstrated exceptional attention to detail, ensuring that all financial transactions were accurately recorded and properly categorized. He/she also worked closely with the organization's leadership to ensure that the new accounting system aligned with their financial goals and objectives. As a result of Manchu's efforts, the Willow Creek Community Center's accounting system underwent a complete transformation. The new system provided the organization with real-time financial data, improved reporting capabilities, and enhanced security measures. Additionally, the staff received comprehensive training, enabling them to efficiently manage the new system and maintain accurate records. The successful completion of this project has significantly improved the financial management of the Willow Creek Community Center. The organization can now make informed decisions based on accurate financial information, streamline their operations, and ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

This is followed by proper utilization of the amount sanctioned to the particular sector . Basically , this process comprise of knowing about the present developments in the fashion industry and trend followed by the people so that we can make the creations circumscribing that . And , from the point of budget or can say the amount spent on a particular display design is also one of the important aspects . So , our objective for example let \\u2019s take summer season creation will be considered as a project and our target will be such that proper and productive use of the materials provided to us and the solution i.e. major number of ideas can be converted into practical display which inturn can be accepted by the head . Selection Learning Launch , if we go with the fundamental definition of this it is implementing the idea into practical in a very fast and cheap process so that if there is a slight possibility of this to fail then we get to quickly switch over to a different or modify the existing so that the glitch can be removed . Application Going through the basic steps that a learning launch comprise of first of all getting the idea and then creating the hypothesis , followed by shaping it according to the needs of the customer so that this not only satisfies their needs but also attracts because of the advantages and comfort . The application of learning launch concept that is one of the tools of design thinking is so that at first we divided the design team into sub teams in which one of them look into the present trend , the other one goes for the new creation implementation which is summer season compatible , and the last one deals with the budget related to the managing and also products required by the designers and also to seek for the best material in a cheap and sustainable way . By the division of the complete team into sub teams and focusing on different aspects that could make the facts of our into any disconfirming facts . The process on the project on summer season designs was very much agile as all together every person was working and were motivated as they focused on the growth of the brand and which inturn would lead to their recognition in the board of designer . Insight By applying the design thinking tool \\u201c Learning launch \\u201d we actually gained and acquired a lot better and deep understanding of how one should convert ideas into practical or can say the real world . This certain tool allows the experimenter to actually carry on their idea in very quick and cheap way so that even if there is any chance of losing .\",\n          \"Based on the central subject of Mind Mapping and the deployment of the 5 persona needs , we started to create links between them . With the help of the illustrated boards , sent beforehand , the participants quickly grasped the Mind Mapping tool and the progressive and synthetic construction of our reflections gradually unfolded before our eyes . The Xmind tool that I used for the exercise was quite practical because it allows you to add annotations as you comment . Certain needs on the secondary crown triggered debates between the participants , I simply chose to develop the ideas on a third level to keep track of the exchange so that I could return to it later . For example , End Users wanted to have feedback from the company restaurant to organize their departure for lunch based on attendance , being able to cancel their meal based on the menu , having access to the daily menu , and so forth . As a result , I created a \\\" restaurant needs \\\" family . Once all work life improvement needs were listed , I suggested that the participants attempt to link the needs of each persona . Continuing the example of restaurant needs , we were able to link those of End User , Facility Manager and Office manager , who wanted him to know more precisely the volume and frequency of attendance in the company restaurant : Same cluster for different reasons ! We created a third crown to detail these the reason of needs . Mapping Visualization : The map is voluntarily simplified to maintain the project \\u2019s confidentiality , a part of the needs examples remains to illustrate the links between clusters . We were thus able to link a dozen needs between the persona , which could be identical , complementary , or interconnected . At this stage , the team was actively engaged at the same level and ideas began to surface , such as creating a smartphone application which could connect persona and meet their different needs in a complementary way . I proposed to define the design criteria for each need , knowing that for the same need the design criteria will be different from one persona to another . This would facilitate the evaluation of ideas in the next \\u2018 what if \\u2019 phase as described by Professor J. Liedtka . Having completed the Mind Mapping phase , I was then able to start the next phase of the design think process which is the brainstorming session ( Not detailed here ) . Insight and approach First and foremost , I really enjoyed managing this Mind Mapping process and I think the participants also appreciated this working session . I was very apprehensive about the videoconference organization ( apart from the course recommendations ) . In the end , people were very relaxed and willing . Everyone contributed and the exchanges have been quite numerous . I limited the exercise to 4 hours and the participants to 7 .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def sanity_check(df):\n","    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n","        # Split the essay into tokens\n","        tokens = row['essay'].split()\n","        # Retrieve the labels\n","        labels = row['labels']\n","\n","        # Check if the number of tokens matches the number of labels\n","        if len(tokens) != len(labels):\n","            print(f\"Row {index} has a mismatch - {len(tokens)} tokens and {len(labels)} labels\")\n","            return False  # Return False if any mismatch is found\n","    return True  # Return True if all rows pass the sanity check\n","\n","# Assuming new_df is your new DataFrame with the split essays and corresponding labels\n","if sanity_check(new_df):\n","    print(\"Sanity check passed: Each token has a corresponding label.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Sanity check failed: There's a mismatch between tokens and labels.\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JroIziy8zohn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713471331877,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1410,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Kiran Reddy Vellanki","userId":"14861279026824216393"}},"outputId":"2640fd4e-8882-43d9-c9c1-2ed048122b34"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sanity check passed: Each token has a corresponding label.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Assuming new_df is your new DataFrame with the split essays and corresponding labels\n","\n","# Define the number of sentences you want to inspect\n","num_sentences_to_print = 5\n","\n","# Print the specified number of sentences\n","for i, row in new_df.head(num_sentences_to_print).iterrows():\n","    print(f\"Row {i}:\")\n","    print(\"Essay:\", row['essay'])\n","    print(\"Labels:\", row['labels'])\n","    print(\"\\n\")  # Add a new line for better readability between the printed essays\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bbOexQ920y45","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713471334618,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":115,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Kiran Reddy Vellanki","userId":"14861279026824216393"}},"outputId":"b4bf682c-9265-4eab-bc6e-9c3d8d4de5da"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Row 0:\n","Essay: Design Thinking for innovation reflexion - Avril 2021 - Nathalie Sylla Challenge & selection The tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the mind map . What exactly is a mind map ? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. ( 1999 , Dessine - moi l'intelligence . Paris : Les Éditions d'Organisation . ) , the mind map ( or heuristic diagram ) is a graphic representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain 's potential to be released . Cf Annex1 This tool has many advantages : • It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done quickly • It is scalable • It allows categorization and linking of information • It can be applied to any type of situation : notetaking , problem solving , analysis , creation of new ideas • It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn • It is fun and encourages exchanges • It makes visible the dimension of projects , opportunities , interconnections • It synthesizes • It makes the project understandable • It allows you to explore ideas The creation of a mind map starts with an idea / problem located at its center . This starting point generates ideas / work areas , incremented around this center in a radial structure , which in turn is completed with as many branches as new ideas . This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized , it is a map of the thoughts . Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method . Application & Insight I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board ( white or paper board ) . In the center of the board , I write and highlight the topic to design . Through a series of questions , I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map . I adapt the series of questions according to the topic to be addressed . In the type of questions , we can use : who , what , when , where , why , how , how much . The use of the “ why ” is very interesting to understand the origin . By this way , the interviewed person frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning . I plan two hours for a workshop . Design Thinking for innovation reflexion - Avril 2021 - Nathalie Sylla After modelling the mind map on paper , I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their work with the addition of color codes , images and interconnections . This second workshop also lasts two hours and allows the mind map to evolve . Once familiarized with it , the stakeholders discover the power of the tool . Then , the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive exchanges between the stakeholders .\n","Labels: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","\n","\n","Row 1:\n","Essay: Around this new mind map , they have learned to work together and want to make visible the untold ideas . I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for decision - makers . These presentations are the core of my business models . The decision - makers are thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them . They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation . Approach What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for the project . This tool helps to give meaning . The participants appropriate the story and want to keep writing it . Then , they easily become actors or sponsors of the project .

As a result of a poorly implemented linear solution , a more customer centric approach was needed . After learning about design thinking in this course , we decided to apply it to solve this problem . The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using diagrams , figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders . Previous to this change , none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them , but the new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them understand the problem in the way the team and I did . Application The process starts in the prep time . The team uses a series of tools and software to develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we created during the process . The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual way , rather than verbally was a game changer . After having a presentation prepared , the team hands an activity to the stakeholders , where the solutions discussed previously appear . Nonetheless , the solutions need more work to them . After this . The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their suggestions would impact on this specific problem . The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their investors . It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as show how customer centric the solutions are . Every complaint and suggestion from customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course ( Involving : can we do it ? Can we afford it ? … ) . The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the stakeholders on the same page . It allows them to completely understand and feel part of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions , which eases the work of the team . Insight & Approach The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team . It increased the productivity and the success rate as well as the customer / stakeholders satisfaction . The use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to Diego Estrada find a solution based on their customer satisfaction . This solution is later revised and tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process . Presentations , graphics , and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction . As a company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the varying levels of understanding , but when paired with the adequate process things just flow .\n","Labels: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","\n","\n","Row 3:\n","Essay: ( This story is fictional and was created for solving the assignment )\n","Labels: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","\n","\n","Row 4:\n","Essay: Reporting process by Gilberto Gamboa Challenge I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller , along with my actual position of Country CFO . The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated those . When I was receiving the position , I went to visit my colleague , former Regional Controller , who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller . The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers sent him an email with the main figures for the week , he forwarded those to his country accountant who consolidated it , the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he finally reported to the headquarters . The whole process took almost a full business day to complete . Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my country had more operations , I decided to change the process in order to reduce the duration and to ensure standardization in the format , and actually , reduce the human intervention , making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file . Selection Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file , I select some of those to determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the process of the information and the reading of the same . In that sense , we form a group of the country controllers , country CEOs , IT guys , and people from the headquarters to find the best solutions possible . Application For the first lunch , we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy - paste processes and reducing the manual intervention so , we build an online application where all the controllers fill the figure of their respective country , along with the comments . During the first week of the first stage , we sent the new report along with the old one , and after the meeting with the headquarters team , we ask for a post - meeting review of the new format , all the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next report . For the second lunch , we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review meeting , we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one . The final report included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment from about 36 men hours to around 8 , without missing any valuable information and including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much . Insight With the application of the learning launch tool , the controller ’s team along with the main stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions .\n","Labels: [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# # Saving the 'results' DataFrame to a CSV file\n","new_df.to_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/ML-Project/PII-DATA/under512data.csv', index=False)  # Set index=False to avoid writing row indices\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wizaIeHC0y2h"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"iGz8QNpV0y0H"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"reC0Ff-20ytL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
